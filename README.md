# Pixelpact ðŸ“¸

Pixeplact gets you started quickly with visual testing for the web.

In contrast to functional or snapshot testing, visual testing verifies that the actually rendered HTML/CSS/JS of your web app truly looks the way it is supposed to. Pixelpact does this by taking screenshots and comparing them to reference images stored in your git repository (using [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/)).

Checkout our [Getting Started Guide](./getting-started.md).

## Goals

Visual testing is not a new idea and there are plenty of other tools, libraries and service providers that offer a similar functionality as we do.In fact, Pixeplact took a lot of inspiration from existing solutions and is based on their hard work! We created Pixelpact with the following goals:

* **Low entry barrier**. We created Pixeplact to provide a solution to get you started quickly with visual testing, without any vendor lock-in or service provider discussions. Start using Pixelpact today and start growing with visual testing.
* **Integrated in Git**. Git is the tool that we use on a daily basis and we have a lot of tools built on top of it, for example for code reviews. Because all our test are stored within our git repositories visual tests should live there too.
* **Optimized for local development environment**: To keep the feedback loop short, we optimize for local development.

## Non-Goals

* **Scale to thousands of screenshots**. The more you rely heavily on visual testing, the more screenshots you have to manage. This will get increasingly difficult and frustrating, especially when simple changes (for example changing the border radius of your buttons) cause a lot of red tests. This is when you grew Pixelpact out - which is great! Now go to a service provider such as Percy.io or Applitools - they have solutions for exactly that!
* **Crazy fast performance**: Although pixeplact is not really slow, it is not crazy fast either. At least for our initial iteration, we won't optimize for speed.
* **Cross-Device nad Corss-Browser Testing**: Fortunately, the differences between the browsers have become smaller. Therefore, it is usually sufficient to test with one browser. If you really need to visually test your web app in 20 different browsers and devices, then Pixelpact is not the solution for you. Currently, we only support chrome and we don't intend to support mobile browsers at all.

## Components

For an overview on our architecture, checkout our [Architecture Guide](./docs/architecture.md).

### Pixelpact

The core of Pixelpact is a docker container that you run in your local development environment. Your tests will run locally and send the required data to this server. Pixelmatch will then respond with the matching result and a optional diff.

### Pixelpact Playwright

Playwright JS integration.

### ... other test frameworks

The integration in other test frameworks requires no witchcraft. We designed our API to make this as simple as possible.
Checkout our playwright integration or the [API Docs](./docs/architecture.md) to roll your own.
